Josync is a light-weight Python application for Windows backup using rsync/cygwin, using shadow copies for read access to open files. Josync is open-source, come join us on GitHub https://github.com/jeinarsson/josync

Features:
   * open-source
   * backup jobs are specified in minimal JSON configuration files,
   * e-mail failure notifications,
   * extensive and configurable logging,
   * translation of mapped network drive letters to UNC paths in order to avoid problems with inaccessible mounted drives on startup

It's not difficult, it's just simple. :doc:`Get started!<getting_started>`
